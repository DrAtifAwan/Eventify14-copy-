3. **Manage RSVPs**:
   - View list of RSVPs and manage attendee counts.

### Additional Functionalities to Enhance the Organizer Dashboard:

   - Add an option to upload images or logos for events.

2. **Event Capacity Management**:
   - Set and manage the maximum number of attendees allowed for an event.
   - Display current attendance count and remaining capacity.

3. **Email Notifications**:
   - Send email notifications to attendees about event updates or reminders.

   - Graphical representation of attendee trends and engagement.

5. **Comments and Feedback**:
   - Allow attendees to leave comments or feedback on events.
   - Display attendee feedback for each event.

6. **Event Calendar View**:

7. **Duplicate Events**:
   - Add an option to duplicate events for recurring or similar events.

8. **Export Event Data**:
   - Export event details and attendee lists to CSV or Excel format.

### Sample Implementation of Additional Functionalities:

#### Upload Event Images or Logos

1. **Database Update**:
   - Add a column for storing image paths in the `events` table.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN image_path VARCHAR(255);
   ```

2. **Organizer Dashboard** (event creation form):

   ```php
   <!-- Update form to include file upload -->
   <form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
       <div class="form-group">
           <label for="event_image">Event Image</label>
           <input type="file" name="event_image" id="event_image" class="form-control">
       </div>
       <!-- Other fields... -->
       <button type="submit" name="create_event" class="btn btn-primary">Create Event</button>
   </form>
   ```

3. **Event Creation Handling**:

   ```php
   if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST' && isset($_POST['create_event'])) {
       // Handle file upload
       $image_path = "";
       if (isset($_FILES['event_image']) && $_FILES['event_image']['error'] == 0) {
           $image_path = 'uploads/' . basename($_FILES['event_image']['name']);
           move_uploaded_file($_FILES['event_image']['tmp_name'], $image_path);
       }

       // Insert event details including image path
       $sql = "INSERT INTO events (name, date, location, description, organizer_id, image_path) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";
       $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);
       $stmt->bind_param("ssssiss", $event_name, $event_date, $event_location, $event_description, $_SESSION['user_id'], $image_path);

       if ($stmt->execute()) {
           echo "<script>alert('Event created successfully!');</script>";
       } else {
           echo "<script>alert('Error: " . $stmt->error . "');</script>";
       }
       $stmt->close();
   }
   ```

### Summary:

1. **Add new functionalities** to enhance the organizer's dashboard.
2. **Implement upload functionality** for event images/logos.
3. **Consider other enhancements** such as capacity management, notifications, analytics, comments, calendar view, duplicate events, and data export.

Implementing these additional features will significantly improve the organizer's experience and make the dashboard more robust and user-friendly. If you need help with any specific implementation, feel free to ask. ðŸ˜Š
